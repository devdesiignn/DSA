# DS & Algo Study Roadmap (12 Weeks)

This repository contains my ongoing journey through data structures and algorithms, following a structured 12-week study plan inspired by:

* **Grokking Data Structures** by Marcello La Rocca
* **Grokking Algorithms** by Aditya Bhargava

---

## About

I‚Äôm using this repo to:

* Implement exercises from both books
* Write tests to validate each data structure and algorithm
* Track progress weekly as I deepen my understanding of DS & Algo concepts

If you're learning along or want to see practical code examples, feel free to explore and contribute!

‚úîÔ∏è Implemented Static Arrays and Sorted Arrays with unit tests

### Week 2: Big-O + Dynamic Arrays

üìñ Chapters from *Grokking Data Structures* ‚Äî [Tasks](https://www.notion.so/Week-2-Tasks-20d8c3ec9c57807195ece2ef9f756ab7)
üîÑ Currently working on Dynamic Arrays and Sorted Dynamic Arrays implementations and tests

### Week 3 - 12

*(To be implemented ‚Äî following the roadmap above)*

## Project Structure

* `/data-structures/` ‚Äî Implementations of data structures
* `/algorithms/` ‚Äî Algorithm implementations
* `/tests/` ‚Äî Unit tests using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev)
* `README.md` ‚Äî This file

---

## How to Run Tests

```bash
npm install
npm run test
```

Tests cover both correctness and performance considerations like resizing and binary search.
